              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p>
                Lovell’s success came through their flagship rugby website, however when it came to diversifying their product by opening a soccer site rather than elevate the store to modern standards and focusing on the difference in audience a cookie cutter approach was taken and the aesthetics and functionality was taken from the existing Lovell Rugby website. As a result the soccer site was not performing to it’s full potential.

              <h3>Limitations</h3>
              <p>
                Instantly we were hit with the fact that changing functionality was going to be in issue, a lack of development resource meant that we had to focus on the design first and any functionality changes would have to be forced through if necessary. The next issue was the tight deadline. We only have a couple of months for design and development, for a complete overhaul like this it’s simply not enough time.

              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>
                With this project rather than tone our designs back from the get go we decided to design what we thought the ideal site would be and then present it to the stakeholders, from here we would remove any elements that we thought were too excessive or took too much development time some of these elements were removed from v1 with the intention of implementing them in the future.

              <h3>Project Goals</h3>
              <p>
                With most ecommerce websites the main goal for stakeholders is to positively impact conversion rates however with this particular site our main goal was to elevate the aesthetics of the platform without negatively impacting the sales of the website.
              </p>
              <p>
                We smashed this target immediately with conversions for the month following release being 15% higher than the 12 month average. Launching in October the following Black Friday was the most profitable day ever for the site, with the highest conversion rate in three years. After the new site hype died down the conversion rate levelled out but is still a significant improvement on the previous stats.

              <h3>My Role</h3>
              <p>
                I was the project lead on this project working internally with our UI/UX Designer, Product Manager and also our Brand Designer. We also worked closely with the Sweatshop team and their internal developers. This project had no real brief before beginning so a large part of my role was getting buy in from all stakeholders and executing on our vision.

              <h3>Learned Lessons</h3>
              <p>
                The biggest note I took away from this project was the importance of targeting the correct demographic especially when it comes to ecommerce businesses although both websites fall into the sporting category a rugby store and a soccer store host very different audiences and even more so when you take into consideration the difference in marketing content and strategy.

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                I think the before and after designs of the website speak for itself. I’m extremely pleased with what the team managed to accomplish with the resources that were available to us. Lovell were so pleased with the new design that they’ve adapted it to other websites under their control.
