              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p>
                While working for the SportsDirect Group our team noticed a small gap in the market that SD were currently not taking advantage of. SportsDirect owned portions of several luxury clothing brands and for the brands they didn’t own they had the distribution rights for. Editorial platforms such as Hypebeast and Highsnobiety were taking advantage of engaging with the luxury consumer audience without having SD’s connections to the clothing business. Why not create a direct competitor?

              <h3>Limitations</h3>
              <p>
                Our main limitation was that this was a concept that is basically being proposed outside of the business. We would have to sell the idea of starting up another business which would cost money and would require a significant number of personal, everything from merchandisers and marketing to photographers and editors not including the development to get the website off the ground.

              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>
                Our solution was to base the branding coming from a sporting point of view. SD are already heavily involved in the sporting industry and it gives them a unique entrance into the market. This idea also takes advantage of the existing relationships with sporting brands that have a foothold in the fashion world for example Nike and Adidas, through these brands SD gain access to exclusive content and athletes/ambassadors.

              <h3>Project Goals</h3>
              <p>
                As this idea started out as a concept our main goal is to make it a reality, having had the initial conversations with the potential stakeholders within the company we're confident that we can get this off the ground soon.

              <h3>My Role</h3>
              <p>
                My role was mainly working out logistics. Everything from development costs to the amount of content we would need to keep the site running which in turn would require a certain head count a lot of this work required competitor analysis, our product manager help a lot of this front. When I wasn’t thinking logistics I was weighing in on the designs coming at it from a developer point of view.

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                This process is still going on and the team are working towards getting this infant of the right people to get it off the ground. We own the URL which came at a big expense and have put the ground work in to put a cost against the development work which we will be partnering with an external agency for that specialise in CraftCMS. There are content plans in place so we can hit the ground running. Our main issue is headcount, getting the buy-in from the people that matter to allow of the hiring cost is proving to be the hardest part of the process.
